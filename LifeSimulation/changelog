- Added changelog

Player.java
- Removed the `isAlive()` function and just re-did the way the menu was being displayed
- Any instance of `get...()` and `set...()` in the Player class was removed and replaced with the names of the variables that were being get and set.
- Fixed the bug with aging past the constant age limit, the program now exits too. (exit code 0)
- Put the things that were important to the game in the Game class, so there's minimal mixup between what's in Player.java and what's in Game.java. 
  Everything to do with the Player is now in Player and everything to do with the Game is now in Game.
  This also helped in removing things like `GetR()` and other things that were in the wrong class.
 
 Game.java
- LOTTERY_PRICE is now in Game.java and static, not sure how I looked past that.
- Switch statements were organized into function calls with the logic in those functions.
- Renamed `plr` to `player`

Insight
There might be a bug with displaying the menu, I'm still trying to figure out how to replicate it.
